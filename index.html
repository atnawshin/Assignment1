            <p id="first-paragraph">Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan
                Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for his
                proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the
                fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland
                Yard.</p>

                    When readers first meet Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlett' he is described as a very thin
                    build,
                    six-foot-tall but his thin build made him seem even taller. His eyes were described as piercing, and
                    his nose was hawk-like which gave him the presence of alertness and firm decision making.</p>

                    If there's anything that Sherlock Holmes has taught us, it's to not rely on talent alone to make it
                    big in this world. The eccentric, brilliant detective solved mysteries with such ease that it's
                    almost impossible to not be jealous of Holmes.</p>

            <p>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who first appeared in
                publication in 1887. He was devised by British author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A brilliant
                London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his prowess at using logic and astute observation to solve
                cases. He is perhaps the most famous fictional detective, and indeed one of the best known and most
                universally recognizable literary characters.</p>

            <h2>Life with </h2>
            <h2>Watson</h2>
            <p>In the first Holmes tale, A Study in Scarlet, financial difficulties lead Holmes and Dr. Watson to share
                rooms together at 221B Baker Street, London.[26] Their residence is maintained by their landlady, Mrs.
                Hudson.[27] Holmes works as a detective for twenty-three years, with Watson assisting him for seventeen
                of those years. Most of the stories are frame narratives written from Watson's point of view, as
                summaries of the detective's most interesting cases. Holmes frequently calls Watson's records of
                Holmes's cases sensational and populist, suggesting that they fail to accurately and objectively report
                the "science" of his craft.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> <span class="color-ivory">Sherlock Holmes</span> , fictional character created by the Scottish writer
                Arthur Conan Doyle. The prototype for
                the modern mastermind detective, Holmes first appeared in Conan Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet, published in
                Beeton’s Christmas Annual of 1887. As the world’s first and only “consulting detective,” he pursued
                criminals throughout Victorian and Edwardian London, the south of England, and continental Europe.
                Although the fictional detective had been anticipated by Edgar Allan Poe’s C. Auguste Dupin and Émile
                Gaboriau’s Monsieur Lecoq, Holmes made a singular impact upon the popular imagination and has been the
                most enduring character of the detective story.​</p>
